## Collaborative Filtering
* Finding K most similar customers 
* Too expensive at the runtime
* Can do pre-computation 


## Matrix Factorization
* Why are low-rank approximations important?
* Allow us to explain the observations by linear combinations of few underlying factors
* Matrix Factorization for dimensionality reduction
* PCA - Representing each point with fewer features without losing much?
* PCA - which variables contribute to the largest variations in the data? Principal components
* We can think of PCA as learning a rotation of canonical axes to align with these principal componnets
while the data cloud is fixed
* Covariance matrix
* Diagnol entried denote variance of each attribute
* Off-diagnol entries denote covariances of each attribute.
